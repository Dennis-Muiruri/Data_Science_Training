    "The use of phone logs to infer relationships between volume of communication and other parameters has been an area of major research interest. In his seminal paper,  which was the first application of phone logs, George Kingsley Zipf (1949) investigated the influence of distance on communication. Many studies have since followed. Big data is characterized by significant increases in structured and unstructured data generated by mobile phones that are sampled and captured at high velocities. Its emergence, and the availability of computer processing technologies that are able to store and process these data sets efficiently, has made it possible to expand these studies in order to improve our understanding of human behavior with unprecedented resolution. Mobile phone data allows the inference of real social networks using call detail records, or CDRs (i.e., phone calls, short message service (SMS) and multimedia message (MMS) communications). These records are combined with GPS and WiFi datasets, browsing habits, application logs, and tower data to reveal a superposition of several social actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Blondel et al. (2015):\n",
    "\n",
    "> *The mobile nature of a mobile phone brings two advantages: first, the temporal patterns of communications [are] reflected in great detail due to the fact that the owner of the device usually carries the device with them and therefore the possibility of receiving the call exists in almost all cases, and second, the positioning data of a mobile phone allows tracking the displacements of its owner*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike self-reported surveys – which are often subjective, limited to a very small subset of the population, and have been the only avenue used to gather data in the past – mobile phone CDRs contain information on verifiable communications between millions of people at a time. Further enrichment from geolocation data, which invariably is also collected alongside CDRs, as well as other external data that is available for the target segment (typically demographics), makes mobile phone CDRs an extremely rich and informative source of data for scientists and analysts. \n",
    "\n",
    "These interactions via mobile phones can be represented by a large network where nodes represent individuals, and links are drawn between individuals that have had a phone call, or exchanged messages or other media. \n",
    "\n",
    "The study of the structure of such networks provides useful insights into their organization, and can assist in improving communication infrastructure, understanding human behavior, traffic planning, and marketing initiatives, among others. According to Gautier Krings (2012), these applications are informed by the extraction and analysis of different kinds of information from large networks, including the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Associating every node with geographical coordinates.** This can facilitate how geography influences the creation of links. More specifically, the intensity of communication between nodes decreases as a power of the geographical distance that separates them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Studying how links in networks change over time (i.e., dynamical networks).** In these networks, new nodes enter or leave the network and the strength of their connections rise and wane during the observation period. Of particular interest is the influence of time scales on the emergence of different structural properties of dynamical networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Detecting communities in networks.** Communities are groups of nodes that are densely connected to each other. \n",

    "The next step is to visualize the graph object – a topic that you briefly touched on in Notebook 1. NetworkX is not primarily a graph drawing package, but provides basic drawing capabilities using Matplotlib. More advanced graph visualization packages can be used. However, these are outside of the scope of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "[NetworkX documentation](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/introduction.html#drawing) (2015) states:\n",
    "> Proper graph visualization is hard, and we highly recommend that people visualize their graphs with tools dedicated to that task. Notable examples of dedicated and fully-featured graph visualization tools are Cytoscape, Gephi, Graphviz and, for LaTeX typesetting, PGF/TikZ.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is an abstract mathematical object without a specific representation in the Cartesian coordinate space, and graph visualization is therefore not a well-defined problem with a unique solution. Depending on which structures in the graph object are of interest, several layout algorithms exist that can be used to optimize node positioning for display visualization. Whenever you want to visualize a graph, you have to find mapping from vertices to Cartesian coordinates first, preferably in a way that is aesthetically pleasing. A separate branch of graph theory, namely graph drawing, attempts to solve this problem via several graph layout algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use the interface provided by [Graphviz](http://graphviz.org/) for node positioning in most of your visualization in this course, because considering other possibilities may distract from the core objectives. Two node positioning algorithms can be accessed using the Graphviz interface provided by NetworkX. They are the following:\n",
    "-  **dot**: \"hierarchical\" or layered drawings of directed graphs. This is the default to use if edges have directionality. The dot algorithm produces a ranked layout of a graph honoring edge directions. It is particularly appropriate for displaying hierarchies or directed acyclic graphs.\n",
    "- **neato**: \"spring model\" layouts.  This is the default to use if the graph is not too large (about 100 nodes), and you don't know anything else about it. Neato attempts to minimize a global energy function, which is equivalent to statistical multidimensional scaling. An ideal spring is placed between every pair of nodes, such that its length is set to the shortest path distance between the endpoints. The springs push the nodes so their geometric distance in the layout approximates their path distance in the graph.\n",
