    "The use of phone logs to infer relationships between volume of communication and other parameters has been an area of major research interest. In his seminal paper,  which was the first application of phone logs, George Kingsley Zipf (1949) investigated the influence of distance on communication. Many studies have since followed. Big data is characterized by significant increases in structured and unstructured data generated by mobile phones that are sampled and captured at high velocities. Its emergence, and the availability of computer processing technologies that are able to store and process these data sets efficiently, has made it possible to expand these studies in order to improve our understanding of human behavior with unprecedented resolution. Mobile phone data allows the inference of real social networks using call detail records, or CDRs (i.e., phone calls, short message service (SMS) and multimedia message (MMS) communications). These records are combined with GPS and WiFi datasets, browsing habits, application logs, and tower data to reveal a superposition of several social actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Blondel et al. (2015):\n",
    "\n",
    "> *The mobile nature of a mobile phone brings two advantages: first, the temporal patterns of communications [are] reflected in great detail due to the fact that the owner of the device usually carries the device with them and therefore the possibility of receiving the call exists in almost all cases, and second, the positioning data of a mobile phone allows tracking the displacements of its owner*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike self-reported surveys – which are often subjective, limited to a very small subset of the population, and have been the only avenue used to gather data in the past – mobile phone CDRs contain information on verifiable communications between millions of people at a time. Further enrichment from geolocation data, which invariably is also collected alongside CDRs, as well as other external data that is available for the target segment (typically demographics), makes mobile phone CDRs an extremely rich and informative source of data for scientists and analysts. \n",
    "\n",
    "These interactions via mobile phones can be represented by a large network where nodes represent individuals, and links are drawn between individuals that have had a phone call, or exchanged messages or other media. \n",
    "\n",
    "The study of the structure of such networks provides useful insights into their organization, and can assist in improving communication infrastructure, understanding human behavior, traffic planning, and marketing initiatives, among others. According to Gautier Krings (2012), these applications are informed by the extraction and analysis of different kinds of information from large networks, including the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Associating every node with geographical coordinates.** This can facilitate how geography influences the creation of links. More specifically, the intensity of communication between nodes decreases as a power of the geographical distance that separates them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Studying how links in networks change over time (i.e., dynamical networks).** In these networks, new nodes enter or leave the network and the strength of their connections rise and wane during the observation period. Of particular interest is the influence of time scales on the emergence of different structural properties of dynamical networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Detecting communities in networks.** Communities are groups of nodes that are densely connected to each other. \n",
